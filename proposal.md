# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Ultimate Snake Game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An application that will run a screen which allows the user to play the classic snake game. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will feature multiple functions that will create the surface of the game, a caption, a quit option to restart the game, and for snake movement. The user will be greeted with a start page with a caption and a button, the user then will click the button the begin the game. The surface of the game will have a grid-like style which will show the user the boundaries of the game. If the user oversteps the boundaries, they will be sent back to the start page. The game will incorporate snake food which will allow the snake to incresase in size by 1. To make it different from a regular snake game we want want to incorporate super foods and random traps inside the game that will make it challenging for the user. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Other than the super foods and traps, I want to atleast get a moving functioning snake and establish the boundaries so that the game will start over if the user goes past them

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A beter outcome will be that the snake will be able to gain size and change color after consuming a certain amount of food

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome of the game will include, traps, snake movement (w/no delays), boundaries (w/force quit), super foods (slows down snake movement which makes it easier for movement for a bried period of time), and start/end captions.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I think my partner and I will have to research how to use pygames and how to enable player movement. We also want to figure out how to display captions within the game, more specfically editing font size, font color, and also adding a button to start the game.
